# Locate ShellCheck in the current environment and pass it the given arguments.

# If ShellCheck is not found, provide instructions for how to install it in the given environment.
#
# To remain consistent with ShellCheck's exit codes, this script will exit with a code of 2 if
# ShellCheck cannot be found locally (unless the `--ignore-missing` option is present).

# OPTIONS:

# Note: All options other than those listed below will be passed directly to the ShellCheck binary.
#
#       --debug             Print debug messages within this script, useful when troubleshooting
#                           $PATH issues.
#   -i, --ignore-missing    Print a warning, but consider the script successful if a local instance
#                           of ShellCheck could not be found.
